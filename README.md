Raspberry Strogonanoff pi v2
======================
This is a complete rip off of https://github.com/dmcg/raspberry-strogonanoff but with a couple of modifications so it works on a Raspberry Pi V2 with WiringPi2-Python from https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi2-Python

This is intended to be used by those who love Raspberry Strogonanoff on their Pi version 1 and just want things to work the same on their new Pi version 2.





Installation
------------

Requires WiringPi2-Python

    git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi2-Python
    cd WiringPi2-Python/
    sudo python setup.py install
